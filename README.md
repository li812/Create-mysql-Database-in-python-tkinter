# Create-mysql-Database-in-python-tkinter
Python tkinter program to create mysql database.
Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database. I recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector". PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment. If not install pip from https://pypi.org/project/pip/
To install "MySQL Connector" run this command :
>> pip install mysql-connector-python
